# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

# Overview of the Analysis 
The purpose of this analysis was to determine the number of retiring employees per title and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program in order to better prepare for the wave of retiring employees.

# Results

Example: Senior Engineer: 25,916 vs Engineer: 9,285 vs Assistant Engineer: 1,090
-	There are no Managers in the mentorship program.
-	There are 1,549 employees across 6 titles that are eligible to mentor their coworkers.

# Summary
-	There are 41,380 employees retiring whose roles needs to be filled and only 1,549 employees who are eligible for the mentorship program. 
-	Depending on the length of the mentorship and how many coworkers are mentored by each senior staff, there are probably not be enough mentors to fully train their replacements one on one. An alternative solution might be to set up “mentorship workshops” where multiple coworkers are coached simultaneously.
-	Further difficulty is introduced due to the fact that the number of mentors are not be proportionally distributed between the departments.
-	The employees will be retiring at a steady rate, the number is about the same each year. Knowing how many mentees need to be trained each year will help with planning a multi-year program. <br>
Number of employees retiring by year: 1952: 9,687, 1953: 10478, 1954: 10,625, 1955: 10,590
